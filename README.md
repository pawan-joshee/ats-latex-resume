# 📄 ATS-Friendly Resume Generator with LaTeX & AI

Welcome to the **ATS-Friendly Resume Generator** repo!  
This tool empowers anyone to create a polished, professional resume in LaTeX—optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)—using AI and Overleaf.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

**1. Prepare Your Resume**
- Find your old resume (PDF, DOCX, or text format).

**2. Use Copilot or ChatGPT to Convert to LaTeX**

- Open GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or any LLM interface.
- Directly upload or paste your resume file (PDF, DOCX, or text) into the chat.
- Use the following prompt:

```
copilot, please convert my resume (attached) into a modern, ATS-friendly LaTeX resume using the template from https://github.com/pawan-joshee/ats-latex-resume. Output only the LaTeX source file.
```

- If your LLM interface allows file attachments, simply upload your resume file. There’s no need for a public URL—modern LLMs can parse the attached file directly.

**3. Get Your LaTeX Resume Source**
- The AI will output a `.tex` file (LaTeX source).
- Copy the entire LaTeX code.

**4. Create Your Resume PDF with Overleaf**
- Go to [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) and sign in (free account is fine).
- Click `New Project > Blank Project`.
- Paste the LaTeX code into `main.tex`.
- Click `Recompile` to generate your PDF resume.

**5. Enhance and Customize!**
- Edit your resume directly in Overleaf to improve formatting, wording, or add additional details.
- Use Overleaf’s preview and version control to make iterations and get feedback.

## 🔄 Alternative Approach: Using Libraries & Packages

Developers can automate the conversion or parsing of resumes into LaTeX format using libraries or packages:

- **Python:** [PyLaTeX](https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX) for generating LaTeX code from structured data.
- **Node.js:** [latex.js](https://github.com/michael-brade/LaTeX.js) or [latex2js](https://github.com/latex2js/latex2js) for LaTeX parsing/generation.
- **Other languages:** Most languages have packages for LaTeX or PDF generation.

**Example:**  
Convert a JSON resume to LaTeX using Python:

```python
from pylatex import Document, Section
doc = Document()
with doc.create(Section('Professional Summary')):
    doc.append('Senior Full-Stack Developer with 4+ years...')
doc.generate_tex('resume_latex')
```

This approach is useful for:
- Batch conversion
- Integrating with resume databases/HR tools
- Automatic customization
